I'm a generalist and [open sourcerer](https://github.com/agucova) that does a bit of everything, but perhaps nothing particularly well. I'm currently the Co-Director of [Kairos](https://kairos-project.org), an AI safety organization that's focused on supporting early career people wanting to go into the field.

I'm very passionate about computer science, cybersecurity and using tech for social impact. Most of my work is interdisciplinary, spanning everything from edtech to metascience, and I've also been involved in public policy, campaigning and activism.

I've been working for a few years under the umbrella of the [Effective Altruism](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/) community, and I think [mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war](https://www.safe.ai/work/statement-on-ai-risk/). This is my main focus right now.

‚ÑπÔ∏è I hold drop-in hours each saturday to talk about Effective Altruism, AI Safety and open source. Feel free to [pass by](https://calendly.com/agucova/drop-in-hours).
